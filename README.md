# Hovercraft
Autonomous Hovercraft Project for ENGR 290 course

Document "main.ino" contains the final version of the code that was tested and used during the competition

This code was run on an Arduino Nano and utilized the following hardware components:
  
  2 x Gens 450 batteries (to power the fans)
  
  1 x AFB1212SH fan (to lift the hovercraft)
 
  1 x MEC0251V1-000U-A99 fan (to provide thrust)
  
  2 x HC-SR04 ultrasound sensors (to detect obstacles on front and left side)
  
  1 x HS-311 servo motor (to turn the thrust fan for steering)
  
  1 x MPU-6050 IMU sensor (to detect heading angle and correct to go straight)
